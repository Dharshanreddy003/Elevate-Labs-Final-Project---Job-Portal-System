Allow employers to post jobs and users to apply.

# 🏢 Job Portal System (Java Console Application)

---

## 📌 Overview
The **Job Portal System** is a simple console-based Java application.  
It allows users to register as either **Employer** or **Applicant**, post and view jobs, and apply to available job opportunities.  

This project helps beginners learn:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Arrays for data storage  
- Loops & conditional statements  
- User input handling in Java  

It does not use external libraries or databases — everything is handled in memory using arrays.
